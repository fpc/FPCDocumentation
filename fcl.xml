<short>Free Pascal FCL: Free Component Library</short>
<descr>
<p>
The Free Component Library is a series of units that implemenent various
classes and non-visual components for use with Free Pascal. They are 
building blocks for non-visual and visual programs, such as designed in
Lazarus. 
</p>
<p>
The <var>TDataset</var> descendents have been implemented in a way that
makes them compatible to the Delphi implementation of these units. There are
other units that have counterparts in Delphi, but most of them are unique to
Free Pascal.
