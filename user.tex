% About this document
\section{About this document}
This is the user's manual for \fpc . It describes the installation and
use of the \fpc compiler on the different supported platforms.
It does not attempt to give an exhaustive list of all supported commands,
nor a definition of the Pascal language. Look at the
\refref for these things. For a description of the possibilities and the 
inner workings of the compiler, see the
\progref . In the appendices of this document you will find lists of
reserved words and compiler error messages (with descriptions).

This document describes the compiler as it is/functions at the time of
writing. First consult the \file{README} and \file{FAQ} files, distributed 
with the compiler. The \file{README} and \file{FAQ} files are, in case of 
conflict with this manual, authoritative.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% About the compiler
\section{About the compiler}
\fpc is a 32-bit compiler for the i386 and m68k processors. Currently, 
it supports the following operating systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item \dos
\item \linux % (Intel, AMD64 and m68k)
\item \amiga (version 0.99.5 only)
\item \windows
\item \ostwo (optionally using the EMX package, so it also works on DOS/Windows)
\item \freebsd
\item \beos (under development)
\item \solaris (under development)
\item \palmos (under development)
\item \netbsd 
\item \netware
\item \openbsd (under development)
\end{itemize}

\fpc is designed to be, as much as possible, source compatible with
Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Delphi 7 (although this goal is not yet attained),
but it also enhances these languages with elements like operator overloading.
And, unlike these ancestors, it supports multiple platforms.

It also differs from them in the sense that you cannot use compiled units
from one system for the other, i.e. you cannot use TP compiled units.

Also, at the time of writing, there is a beta version of an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) available for \fpc.

\fpc consists of several parts :
\begin{enumerate}
\item The compiler program itself.
\item The Run-Time Library (RTL).
\item The packages. This is a collection of many utility units, ranging from
the whole Windows 32 API, through native ZIP/BZIP file handling to the whole GTK-2 interface.
\item The Free Class Library. This is a set of class-based utility units which give
a database framework, image support, web support, XML support and many many more.
\item Utility programs and units.
\end{enumerate}

Of these you only need the first two, in order to be able to use the compiler.
In this document, we describe the use of the compiler. The RTL is described in the
\refref.

\chapter{Installing the compiler}
\label{ch:Installation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Before Installation : Requirements
\section{Before Installation : Requirements}

%
% System requirements
%
\subsection{Hardware requirements}
The compiler needs at least one of the following processors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An Intel 80386 or higher processor. A coprocessor 
is not required, although it will slow down your program's performance if you do 
floating point calculations without a coprocessor, since emulation will be used.
\item An AMD64 or EMT64 processor. 
\item A PowerPC processor. 
\item A SPARC processor
\item A Intel ARM processor.
\item Older FPC versions exist for the motorola 68000 processor, 
but these are no longer maintained.
\end{enumerate}


Memory and disk requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 8 Megabytes of free memory. This is for compiling small programs. 
\item Large programs such as the compiler will require at least 64 Mb. 
of memory, but 128Mb is recommended. 
(note that the programs themselves do not need so much memory)
\item At least 80 Megabytes free disk space. 
When the sources are installed, another 270 Megabytes are needed.
\end{enumerate}

% Software requirements
\subsection{Software requirements}

\subsubsection{Under DOS}
The \dos distribution contains all the files you need to run the compiler
and compile pascal programs.

\subsubsection{Under UNIX}
Under \unix systems (such as \linux) you need to have the following programs 
installed :
\begin{enumerate}
\item \gnu \file{as}, the \gnu assembler.
\item \gnu \file{ld}, the \gnu linker.
\item Optionally (but highly recommended) : \gnu \file{make}. For easy
recompiling of the compiler and Run-Time Library, this is needed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Under Windows}
The \windows distribution contains all the files you need to run the compiler
and compile pascal programs. However, it may be a good idea to install
the \file{mingw32} tools or the \var{cygwin} development tools. Links
to both of these tools can be found on \var{http://www.freepascal.org}

\subsubsection{Under OS/2}
While the \fpc distribution comes with all necessary tools, it is a good
idea to install the EMX extender in order to compile and run
programs with the Free Pascal compiler. The EMX extender can be found on:\\
\var{http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/index.html}

\subsubsection{Under Mac OS X}
Mac OS X 10.1 or higher is required, and the developer tools or XCode 
should be installed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Installing the compiler.
\section{Installing the compiler.}
The installation of \fpc is easy, but is platform-dependent.
We discuss the process for each platform separately.

% Installing under DOS
\subsection{Installing under DOS, Windows or OS/2}
\subsubsection{Mandatory installation steps.}
First, you must get the latest distribution files of \fpc. They come as zip
files, which you must unzip first, or you can download the compiler as a
series of separate files. This is especially useful if you have a slow
connection, but it is also nice if you want to install only some parts of the
compiler distribution.  The distribution zip files for DOS or OS/2 contain an
installation program \file{INSTALL.EXE}. You must run this program to install
the compiler.

For Windows, there is a Windows installer, \file{setup.exe}, this is a normal 
windows installation program, which offers the usual options.

The screen of the DOS or OS/2 installation program looks like figure 
\ref{fig:install1}.

\FPCpic{The \dos install program screen}{}{install1}
\FPCpic{}{}{install2}

The program allows you to select:
\begin{itemize}
\item What components you wish to install. e.g do you want the sources or
not, do you want docs or not. Items that you didn't download when
downloading as separate files, will not be enabled, i.e. you can't
select them.

\item Where you want to install (the default location is \verb|C:\PP|).
\end{itemize}

In order to run \fpc from any directory on your system, you must extend
your path variable to contain the \verb|C:\PP\BIN| directory.
Usually this is done in the \file{AUTOEXEC.BAT} file.
It should look something like this :
\begin{verbatim}
  SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\PP\BIN\GO32V2
\end{verbatim}
for \dos or 
\begin{verbatim}
  SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\PP\BIN\WIN32
\end{verbatim}
for \windows and finally
\begin{verbatim}
  SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\PP\BIN\OS2
\end{verbatim}
for \ostwo.
(Again, assuming that you installed in the default location).

On \ostwo, \fpc installs some libraries from the EMX package if they
were not yet installed (the installer will notify you if they should be
installed). They are located in the 
\begin{verbatim}
C:\PP\DLL
\end{verbatim}
directory. The name of this directory should be added to the \var{LIBPATH}
directive in the \file{config.sys} file:
\begin{verbatim}
LIBPATH=XXX;C:\PP\DLL
\end{verbatim}
Obviously, any existing directories in the \var{LIBPATH} directive
(indicated by \var{XXX} in the above example) should be preserved.

\subsubsection{Optional Installation: The coprocessor emulation}
For people who have an older CPU type, without math coprocessor (i387)
it is necessary to install a coprocessor emulation, since \fpc uses the
coprocessor to do all floating point operations.

The installation of the coprocessor emulation is handled by the
installation program (\file{INSTALL.EXE}) under \dos and \windows.

%
% Installing under Linux
%
\subsection{Installing under Linux}
\subsubsection{Mandatory installation steps.}
The \linux distribution of \fpc comes in three forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \file{tar.gz} version, also available as seperate files.
\item a \file{.rpm} (Red Hat Package Manager) version, and
\item a \file{.deb} (Debian) version.
\end{itemize}

If you use the \file{.rpm} format, installation is limited to
\begin{verbatim}
rpm -i fpc-X.Y.Z-N.ARCH.rpm
\end{verbatim}
Where \var{X.Y.Z} is the version number of the \file{.rpm} file, and \var{ARCH} is one of the supported architectures (i586, x86\_64 etc.).

If you use Debian, installation is limited to
\begin{verbatim}
dpkg -i fpc-XXX.deb
\end{verbatim}
Here again, \var{XXX} is the version number of the \file{.deb} file.

You need root access to install these packages. The \file{.tar} file
allows you to do an installation if you don't have root permissions.

When downloading the \var{.tar} file, or the separate files,
installation is more interactive.

In case you downloaded the \file{.tar} file, you should first untar
the file, in some directory where
you have write permission, using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
tar -xvf fpc.tar
\end{verbatim}
We supposed here that you downloaded the file \file{fpc.tar} somewhere
from the Internet. (The real filename will have some version number in it,
which we omit here for clarity.)

When the file is untarred, you will be left with more archive files, and
an install program: an installation shell script.

If you downloaded the files as separate files, you should at least download
the \file{install.sh} script, and the libraries (in \file{libs.tar.gz}).

To install \fpc, all that you need to do now is give the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
./install.sh
\end{verbatim}
And then you must answer some questions. They're very simple, they're
mainly concerned with 2 things :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Places where you can install different things.
\item Deciding if you want to install certain components (such as sources
and demo programs).
\end{enumerate}
The script will automatically detect which components are present and can be
installed. It will only offer to install what has been found.
because of this feature, you must keep the original names when downloading,
since the script expects this.

If you run the installation script as the \var{root} user, you can just accept all installation
defaults. If you don't run as \var{root}, you must take care to supply the
installation program with directory names where you have write permission,
as it will attempt to create the directories you specify.
In principle, you can install it wherever you want, though.

At the end of installation, the installation program will generate a
configuration file (\file{fpc.cfg}) for the \fpc compiler which 
reflects the settings that you chose. It will install this file in 
the \file{/etc} directory or in your home directory (with name
\file{.fpc.cfg}) if you do not have write permission in the \file{/etc}
directory. It will make a copy in the directory where you installed the 
libraries.

The compiler will first look for a file \file{.fpc.cfg} in your home 
directory before looking in the \file{/etc} directory.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Optional configuration
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Optional configuration steps}
On any platform, after installing the compiler you may wish to set
some environment variables. The \fpc compiler recognizes the 
following variables :

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|PPC_EXEC_PATH| contains the directory where support files for
the compiler can be found.
\item \verb|PPC_CONFIG_PATH| specifies an alternate path to find the \file{fpc.cfg}.
\item \verb|PPC_ERROR_FILE|  specifies the path and name of the error-definition file.
\item \verb|FPCDIR| specifies the root directory of the \fpc installation.
(e.g : \verb|C:\PP\BIN|)
\end{itemize}

These locations are, however, set in the sample configuration file which is
built at the end of the installation process, except for the
\verb|PPC_CONFIG_PATH| variable, which you must set if you didn't install
things in the default places.

\section{Before compiling}

Also distributed in \fpc is a README file. It contains the latest
instructions for installing \fpc, and should always be read first.

Furthermore, platform-specific information and common questions
are addressed in the \var{FAQ}. It should be read before reporting any 
bug.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Testing the compiler
\section{Testing the compiler}

After the installation is completed and the optional environment variables 
are set as described above, your first program can be compiled.

Included in the \fpc distribution are some demonstration programs,
showing what the compiler can do.
You can test if the compiler functions correctly by trying to compile
these programs.

The compiler is called
\begin{itemize}
\item \file{fpc.exe} under \windows, \ostwo and \dos.
\item \file{fpc} under most other operating systems.
\end{itemize}
To compile a program (e.g \verb|demo\hello.pp|) simply type :
\begin{verbatim}
  fpc hello
\end{verbatim}
at the command prompt. If you don't have a configuration file, then you may
need to tell the compiler where it can find the units, for instance as
follows:
\begin{verbatim}
fpc -Fuc:\pp\units\go32v2\rtl hello
\end{verbatim}
under \dos, and under \linux you could type
\begin{verbatim}
fpc -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/NNN/units/linux/rtl hello
\end{verbatim}
(replace \var{NNN} with the version number of \fpc that you are using).
This is, of course, assuming that you installed under \verb|C:\PP| or
\file{/usr/lib/fpc/NNN}, respectively.

If you got no error messages, the compiler has generated an executable
called \file{hello.exe} under \dos, \ostwo or \windows, or \file{hello} 
(no extension) under \unix and most other operating systems.

To execute the program, simply type :
\begin{verbatim}
  hello
\end{verbatim}
If all went well, you should see the following friendly greeting:
\begin{verbatim}
Hello world
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Usage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Compiler usage}
\label{ch:Usage}

Here we describe the essentials to compile a program and a unit.
For more advanced uses of the compiler, see the section on configuring 
the compiler, and the \progref{}.

The examples in this section suppose that you have a \file{fpc.cfg} which
is set up correctly, and which contains at least the path setting for the
RTL units. In principle this file is generated by the installation program.
You may have to check that it is in the correct place (see section
\ref{se:configfile} for more information on this).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Where the compiler looks for its files.
\section{File searching}
Before you start compiling a program or a series of units, it is
important to know where the compiler looks for its source files and other
files. In this section we discuss this, and we indicate how to influence
this.

\begin{remark}
The use of slashes (/) and backslashes (\verb+\+) as directory separators
is irrelevant, the compiler will convert to whatever character is used on
the current operating system. Examples will be given using slashes, since
this avoids problems on \unix systems (such as \linux).
\end{remark}

% Command-line files.
\subsection{Command line files}
The file that you specify on the command line, such as in
\begin{verbatim}
fpc foo.pp
\end{verbatim}
will be looked for ONLY in the current directory. If you specify a directory
in the filename, then the compiler will look in that directory:
\begin{verbatim}
fpc subdir/foo.pp
\end{verbatim}
will look for \file{foo.pp} in the subdirectory \file{subdir} of the current
directory.

Under case sensitive file systems (such as \linux and \unix), the name of this 
file is case sensitive, under other operating systems (such as \dos, \windowsnt, \ostwo) 
this is not the case.

% Unit files.
\subsection{Unit files}

When you compile a unit or program that needs other units, the compiler will
look for compiled versions of these units in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It will look in the current directory.
\item It will look in the directory where the source file is being compiled.
\item It will look in the directory where the compiler binary is.
\item It will look in all the directories specified in the unit search path.
\end{enumerate}

You can add a directory to the unit search path with the (\seeo{Fu})
option. Every occurrence of one of this options will {\em insert}
a directory to the unit search path. i.e. the last path on the command line
will be searched first.

The compiler adds several paths to the unit search path:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The contents of the environment variable \var{XXUNITS}, where \var{XX}
must be replaced with one of the supported targets: \var{GO32V2},
\var{LINUX},\var{WIN32}, \var{OS2}, \var{BEOS}, \var{FREEBSD}, \var{NETBSD}.
\item The standard unit directory. This directory is determined
from the \var{FPCDIR} environment variable. If this variable is not set,
then it is defaulted to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item On \linux:
\begin{verbatim}
  /usr/local/lib/fpc/FPCVERSION
or
  /usr/lib/fpc/FPCVERSION
\end{verbatim}
whichever is found first.
\item On other OSes: the compiler binary directory, with '../' appended
to it, if it exists. For instance, on Windows, this would mean
\begin{verbatim}
C:\FPC\1.9.6\units\i386-win32
\end{verbatim}
This is assuming the compiler was installed in the directory
\begin{verbatim}
C:\FPC\1.9.6
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
After this directory is determined , the following paths are added to the
search path:
\begin{enumerate}
\item FPCDIR/units/FPCTARGET
\item FPCDIR/units/FPCTARGET/rtl
\end{enumerate}
Here target must be replaced by the name of the target you are compiling
for: this is a combination of CPU and OS, so for instance
\begin{verbatim}
/usr/local/lib/fpc/1.9.6/units/i386-linux/
\end{verbatim}
or, when cross-compiling
\begin{verbatim}
/usr/local/lib/fpc/1.9.6/units/i386-win32/
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Note that (for optimization) the compiler will drop any non-existing paths 
from the search path, i.e. the existence of the path will be tested.

You can see what paths the compiler will search by giving the compiler
the \var{-vu} option.

On systems where filenames are case sensitive (such as \unix and \linux), 
the compiler will :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Search for the original file name, i.e. preserves case.
\item Search for the filename all lowercased.
\item Search for the filename all uppercased.
\end{enumerate}
This is necessary, since Pascal is case-independent, and the statements 
\var{Uses Unit1;} or \var{uses unit1;} should have the same effect.

It will do this first with the extension \file{.pp} and then with the
extension \file{.pas}.

For instance, suppose that the file \file{foo.pp} needs the unit
\file{bar}. Then the command
\begin{verbatim}
fpc -Fu.. -Fuunits foo.pp
\end{verbatim}
will tell the compiler to look for the unit \file{bar} in the following
places:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the current directory.
\item In the directory where the compile binary is (not under \linux).
\item In the parent directory of the current directory.
\item In the subdirectory \file{units} of the current directory
\item In the standard unit directory.
\end{enumerate}

Also, unit names that are longer than 8 characters will first be looked for
with their full length. If the unit is not found with this name, the name
will be truncated to 8 characters, and the compiler will look again in the
same directories, but with the truncated name.


If the compiler finds the unit it needs, it will look for the source file of
this unit in the same directory where it found the unit.
If it finds the source of the unit, then it will compare the file times.
If the source file was modified more recent than the unit file, the
compiler will attempt to recompile the unit with this source file.

If the compiler doesn't find a compiled version of the unit, or when the
\var{-B} option is specified, then the compiler will look in the same
manner for the unit source file, and attempt to recompile it.

It is recommended to set the unit search path in the configuration file
\file{fpc.cfg}. If you do this, you don't need to specify the unit search
path on the command-line every time you want to compile something.

% Include files.
\subsection{Include files}
If you include files in your source with the \var{\{\$I filename\}}
directive, the compiler will look for it in the following places:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It will look in the path specified in the include file name.
\item It will look in the directory where the current source file is.
\item it will look in all directories specified in the include file search
path.
\end{enumerate}
You can add files to the include file search path with the \seeo{I} or
\seeo{Fi} options.

As an example, consider the following include statement in a file
\file{units/foo.pp}:
\begin{verbatim}

{$i ../bar.inc}

\end{verbatim}
Then the following command :
\begin{verbatim}
fpc -Iincfiles units/foo.pp
\end{verbatim}
will cause the compiler to look in the following directories for
\file{bar.inc}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the parent directory of the current directory
\item the \file{units} subdirectory of the current directory
\item the \file{incfiles} directory of the current directory.
\end{enumerate}

% Object files.
\subsection{Object files}
When you link to object files (using the \var{\{\$L file.o\}} directive,
the compiler will look for this file in the same way as it looks for include
files:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It will look in the path specified in the object file name.
\item It will look in the directory where the current source file is.
\item it will look in all directories specified in the object file search path.
\end{enumerate}
You can add files to the object file search path with the \seeo{Fo} option.

% Configuration file
\subsection{Configuration file}
\label{searchconfig}

Not all options mus be given on the compiler commandline. The compiler
can use a configuration file wich can contain the same options as on the
command-line. Unless you specify the \seeo{n} option, the compiler will look
for a configuration file \file{fpc.cfg} in the following places:

\begin{itemize}
\item Under \unix (such as \linux)
\begin{enumerate}
\item The current directory.
\item In your home directory, it looks for \file{.fpc.cfg}.
\item The directory specified in the environment variable
\var{PPC\_CONFIG\_PATH}, and if it is not set, it will look in the 
\file{etc} directory above the compiler directory. (for instance, if the
compiler is in \file{/usr/local/bin}, it will look in \file{/usr/local/etc})
\item In the directory \file{/etc}.
\end{enumerate}
\item Under all other OSes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The current directory.
\item If it is set, the directory specified in the environment variable.
\var{PPC\_CONFIG\_PATH}.
\item The directory where the compiler is.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Versions prior to version 1.0.6 of the compiler used a configuration
file \file{ppc386.cfg}. This file is still searched, but it's usage 
is considered deprecated. For compatibility, \file{fpc.cfg} will
be searched first, and if not found, the file \file{ppc386.cfg}
will be used.


\subsection{About long filenames}
\fpc can handle long filenames under on all platforms, except DOS; 
On windows, it will use support for long filenames if it is available
(which is not always the case on older windowses).

If no support for long filenames is present, it will truncate unit names
to 8 characters.

It is not recommended to put units in directories that contain spaces in
their names, since the linker doesn't understand such filenames.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compiling a program
\section{Compiling a program}
Compiling a program is very simple. Assuming that you have a program source
in the file \file{prog.pp}, you can compile this with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
  fpc [options] prog.pp
\end{verbatim}
The square brackets \var{[\ ]} indicate that what is between them is optional.

If your program file has the \file{.pp} or \file{.pas} extension,
you can omit this on the command line, e.g. in the previous example you
could have typed:
\begin{verbatim}
  fpc [options] prog
\end{verbatim}

If all went well, the compiler will produce an executable file. You can execute 
it straight away, you don't need to do anything else. 

You will notice that there is also another file in your directory, with
extensions \file{.o}. This contains the object file for your program.
If you compiled a program, you can delete the object file (\file{.o}),
but not if you compiled a unit.

Then the object file contains the code of the unit, and will be
linked in any program that uses the unit you compiled, so you shouldn't
remove it.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compiling a unit
\section{Compiling a unit}

Compiling a unit is not essentially different from compiling a program.
The difference is mainly that the linker isn't called in this case.

To compile a unit in the file \file{foo.pp}, just type :
\begin{verbatim}
  fpc  foo
\end{verbatim}
Recall the remark about file extensions in the previous section.

When all went well, you will be left with 2 (two) unit files:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \file{foo.ppu} This is the file describing the unit you just
compiled.
\item \file{foo.o} This file contains the actual code of the unit.
This file will eventually end up in the executables.
\end{enumerate}
Both files are needed if you plan to use the unit for some programs.
So don't delete them. If you want to distribute the unit, you must
provide both the \file{.ppu} and \file{.o} file. One is useless without the
other.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Units libraries and smartlinking
\section{Units, libraries and smartlinking}
The \fpc compiler supports smartlinking and the creation of libraries.
However, the default behaviour is to compile each unit into 1 big object
file, which will be linked as a whole into your program.
Shared libraries can be created on any platform except MS-DOS.

It is also possible to take existing units and put them
together in 1 static or shared library (using the \file{ppumove} tool,
\sees{ppumove}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Reducing the size of your program
\section{Reducing the size of your program}

When you created your program, it is possible to reduce its size. This
is possible, because the compiler leaves a lot of information in the
program which, strictly speaking, isn't required for the execution of
it. The surplus of information can be removed with a small program
called \file{strip}.The usage is simple. Just type
\begin{verbatim}
strip prog
\end{verbatim}
On the command line, and the \file{strip} program will remove all unnecessary
information from your program. This can lead to size reductions of up to
30 \%.

\begin{remark}
In the \win version, \file{strip} is called \file{stripw}.
\end{remark}
You can use the \var{-Xs} switch to let the compiler do this stripping
automatically at program compile time (the switch has no effect when
compiling units).

Another technique to reduce the size of a program is to use smartlinking.
Normally, units (including the system unit) are linked in as a whole.
It is however possible to compile units such that the can be smartlinked.
This means that only the functions and procedures are linked in your
program, leaving out any unnecessary code. The compiler will turn on
smartlinking with the \seeo{XX} switch. This technique is described in
full in the programmers guide.

% General problems
\section{General problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IO-error -2 at ...} : Under \linux you can get this message at
compiler startup. It means typically that the compiler doesn't find the
error definitions file. You can correct this mistake with the \seeo{Fr}
option under \linux.
\item \textbf {Error : File not found : xxx} or \textbf{Error: couldn't compile
unit xxx}: This typically happens when
your unit path isn't set correctly. Remember that the compiler looks for
units only in the current directory, and in the directory where the compiler
itself is. If you want it to look somewhere else too, you must explicitly
tell it to do so using the \seeo{Fu} option. Or you must set op
a configuration file.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problems you may encounter under DOS
\section{Problems you may encounter under DOS}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{No space in environment}.\\
An error message like this can occur, if you call
\verb|SET_PP.BAT| in the \file{AUTOEXEC.BAT}.\\
To solve this problem, you must extend your environment memory.
To do this, search a line in the \file{CONFIG.SYS} like
\begin{verbatim}
SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM
\end{verbatim}
and change it to the following:
\begin{verbatim}
SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM /E:1024
\end{verbatim}
You may just need to specify a higher value, if this parameter is already set.
\item \textbf{ Coprocessor missing}\\
If the compiler writes
a message that there is no coprocessor, install
the coprocessor emulation.
\item \textbf{Not enough DPMI memory}\\
If you want to use the compiler with \var{DPMI} you must have at least
7-8 MB free \var{DPMI} memory, but 16 Mb is a more realistic amount.
\end{itemize}

% Configuration.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Compiler configuration}
\label{ch:CompilerConfiguration}

The output of the compiler can be controlled in many ways. This can be done
essentially in two distinct ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using command-line options.
\item Using the configuration file: \file{fpc.cfg}.
\end{itemize}
The compiler first reads the configuration file. Only then the command line
options are checked. This creates the possibility to set some basic options
in the configuration file, and at the same time you can still set some
specific options when compiling some unit or program. First we list the
command line options, and then we explain how to specify the command
line options in the configuration file. When reading this, keep in mind
that the options are case sensitive. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Using the command-line options
\section{Using the command-line options}

The available options for the current version of the compiler are listed by
category. Also, \seec{commandlineoptions} for a listing as generated by 
the current compiler.

%
% General options

\subsection{General options}
\begin{description}
\item[-h] if you specify this option, the compiler outputs a list of all options,
and exits after that.
\olabel{h}
\item[-?] idem as \var{-h}, waiting after every screenfull for the enter key.
\item[-i] This option tells the compiler to print the copyright information.
\olabel{i} You can give it an option, as \var{-ixxx} where xxx can be one of the
following:
\begin{description}
\item[D] : Returns the compiler date.
\item[V] : Returns the compiler version.
\item[SO] : Returns the compiler OS.
\item[SP] : Returns the compiler processor.
\item[TO] : Returns the target OS.
\item[TP] : Returns the target Processor.
\end{description}
\item[-l] This option tells the compiler to print the \fpc logo on standard
output. It also gives you the \fpc version number.
\olabel{l}
\item [-n] Tells the compiler not to read default the configuration file.
You can still pass a configuration file with the \var{@} option.
\olabel{n}

functions as it is processing them.
\item \var{c} : Tells the compiler to warn you when it processes a
conditional.
\item \var{m} : Tells the compiler to write which macros are defined.
\item \var{d} : Tells the compiler to write other debugging info.
\item \var{0} : Tells the compiler to write no messages. This is useful when
you want to override the default setting in the configuration file.
\item \var{b} : Tells the compiler to show all procedure declarations if an
overloaded function error occurs.
\item \var{x} : Tells the compiler to output some executable info (for Win32
platform only).
\item \var{r} : Rhide/GCC compatibility mode: formats the errors
differently, so they are understood by RHIDE.
\item \var{a} : Tells the compiler to write all possible info. (this is the
same as specifying all options)
%\item \var{b} : Tells the compiler to write filenames using the full path.
\item \var{v} write a file \file{fpcdebug.txt} with lots of debugging info.
Mainly for the compiler developers.

(the linker).
\olabel{e}
\item[-FaXYZ] loads units \var{XYZ} after the system unit, but before any other 
unit is loaded. \var{XYZ} is a comma-separated list of unit names. This can only be used
for programs, and has the same effect as if \var{XYZ} were inserted as the
first item in the program's \var{uses} clause.
\item[-FcXXX] set the input codepage to \var{XXX}. Experimental.
\item [-FD] same as \var{-e}.
\item [-Fexxx] This option tells the compiler to write errors, etc. to
the file named \file{xxx}.
\olabel{Fe}
\item [-FExxx] tells the compiler to write the executable and units in
directory \file{xxx} instead of th current directory.
\olabel{FE}
\item [-Fixxx] Adds \var{xxx} to the include file search path.
\olabel{Fi}
\item [-Flxxx] Adds \var{xxx} to the library searching path, and is passed
to the linker.

messages. Default the compiler has built-in messages. Specifying this option
will override the default messages.
\olabel{Fr}
\item [-Fuxxx] Add \file{xxx} to the unit search path.
Units are first searched in the current directory.
If they are not found there then the compiler searches them in the unit path.
You must {\em always} supply the path to the system unit.
\olabel{Fu}
\item [-FUxxx] Tells the compiler to write units in directory \var{xxx}
instead of the current directory. It overrides the \var{-FE} option.
\item [-Ixxx] \olabel{I} Add \file{xxx} to the include file search path.
This option has the same effect as \var{-Fi}.

\item [-a] \olabel{a} Tells the compiler not to delete the assembler files
it generates (not when using the internal assembler).
This also counts for the (possibly) generated batch script.
\item [-al] \olabel{al} Tells the compiler to include the sourcecode lines
in the assembler file as comments.
\item[-an] \olabel{an} Tells the compiler to write node information in the
assember file (nodes are the way the compiler represents statements or parts
thereof internally). This is primarily intended for debugging
the code generated by the compiler.
\item[-ap] \olabel{ap} use pipes instead of creating temporary assembler
files.  This may speed up the compiler on \ostwo and \linux. 
Only with assemblers (such as \gnu %\file{as}) that support piping, and not
if the internal assembler is used.
\item[-ar] \olabel{ar} tells the compiler to list register allocation and
release info in the assembler file. This is primarily intended for debugging
the code generated by the compiler.
\item[-at] \olabel{at} tells the compiler to list information about
temporary allocations and deallocations in the assembler file.
\item [-Axxx] \olabel{A} specifies what kind of assembler should be generated . Here

\item[-B] \olabel{B} tells the compiler to re-compile all used units, even
if the unit sources didn't change since the last compilation.
\item[-b] \olabel{b} tells the compiler to generate browser info. This information can
be used by an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to provide information
on classes, objects, procedures, types  and variables in a unit.
\item[-bl] \olabel{bl} is the same as \var{-b} but also generates
information about local variables, types and procedures.

acesses an array element with an invalid index, or if it increases an
enumerated type beyond it's scope, a run-time error will be generated.
\item [-CR] \olabel{CR} Generate checks when calling methods to verify
if the virtual method table for that object is valid.
\item [-Csxxx] \olabel{Cs} Set stack size to \var{xxx}.
\item [-Ct] \olabel{Ct} generate stack checking code. In case your program
performs a faulty stack operation, a run-rime error will be generated.
\item [-CX] \olabel{Cx} Create a smartlinked unit when writing a unit.
smartlinking will only link in the code parts that are actually needed by
the program. All unused code is left out. This can lead to substantially
smaller binaries.

to conditionally compile parts of your code.
\item [-D] generate a DEF file (for OS/2)
\item [-Dd] set the description of the executable/library (Windows)

that all pointer accesses are within the heap.
\item [-gd] \olabel{gd} generate debugging info for \file{dbx}.
\item [-gg] idem as \var{-g}.
\item [-gh] use the heaptrc unit (see \unitsref). (produces a report

\item[Pn] (Intel only) Specify processor: \var{n} can be one of
\begin{description}
\item[1] optimize for 386/486
\item[2] optimize for Pentium/PentiumMMX (tm)
\item[3] optimizations for PentiumPro/PII/Cyrix 6x86/K6 (tm)
\end{description}
\end{description}
The exact effect of these optimizations can be found in the \progref.
\item [-oxxx] Tells the compiler to use \var{xxx} as the name of the output
file (executable). Only with programs.
\item [-pg] \olabel{gp} Generate profiler code for \file{gprof}. This will
define the symbol \var{FPC\_PROFILE}, which can be used in conditional
defines.
\item [-s] \olabel{s} Tells the compiler not to call the assembler and linker.
Instead, the compiler writes a script, \file{PPAS.BAT} under \dos, or
\file{ppas.sh} under \linux, which can then be executed to produce an
executable. This can be used to speed up the compiling process or to debug
the compiler's output. This option can take some extra parameter, mainly
used for cross-compilation. It can have one of the following values:
\begin{description}
\item[h] Generate script to link on host. The generated script can be run on
the compilation platform (host platform).
\item[t] Generate script to link on target platform. The generated script
can be run on the target platform. (where the binary must be run)

of the \var{-d} option.
\item [-Ur] \olabel{Ur} Generate release unit files. These files will not be
recompiled, even when the sources are available. This is useful when making
release distributions. This also overrides the \var{-B} option for release 
mode units.
\item[-W] set some \windows or \ostwo attributes of the generated binary. It
can be one or more of the following
\begin{description}
\item[Bhhh] set preferred base address to hhh (a hexadecimal address)

kind of executable should be generated. the parameter \var{x}
can be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{c} : (\linux only) Link with the C library. You should only use this when
  you start to port \fpc to another operating system. \olabel{Xe}
\item \textbf{d} don't use the standard library path. This is needed for
cross-compilation, to avoid linking with the host platform's libraries.
\item \textbf{D} : Link with dynamic libraries (defines the
\var{FPC\_LINK\_DYNAMIC} symbol) \olabel{XD}
\item \textbf{MXXX} : Set the name of the program entry routine 
The default is 'main'.
\item \textbf{PXXX} : Prepend binutils names with  \var{XXX} for cross-compiling.

% Options concerning the sources (language options)

\subsection{Options concerning the sources (language options)}
\label{se:sourceoptions}
for more information on these options, see also \progref
\begin{description}
\item[-Mmode] \olabel{M} set language mode to \var{mode}, which can be one of the
following:
\begin{description}
\item[delphi] tries to be Delphi compatible. This is more strict
than the \var{objfpc} mode, since some \fpc extensions are switched off.
\item[fpc] free pascal dialect (default)
\item[gpc] tries to be gpc compatible.
\item[macpas] tries to be compatible to the macintosh pascal dialects.
\item[objfpc] switch some Delphi 2 extensions on. This is different from 
Delphi mode. because some \fpc constructs are still available.
\item[tp] tries to be TP/BP 7.0 compatible. This means, no function overloading
etc.
\end{description}
\item [-Rxxx] \olabel{R} Specifies what kind of assembler you use in
your \var{asm} assembler code blocks. Here \var{xxx} is one of the following:
\begin{description}
\item [att\ ] \var{asm} blocks contain AT\&T-style  assembler.
This is the default style.
\item [intel] \var{asm} blocks contain Intel-style assembler.
\item [direct] \var{asm} blocks should be copied as-is in the assembler,
only replacing certain variables.
file.
\end{description}
\item [-S2] \olabel{Stwo} Switch on Delphi 2 extensions (\var{objfpc} mode). 
Deprecated, use \var{-Mobjfpc} instead.
\item [-Sa] \olabel{Sa} Include assert statements in compiled code. Omitting 
this option will cause assert statements to be ignored.
\item [-Sc] \olabel{Sc} Support C-style operators, i.e. \var{*=, +=, /= and
-=}.
\item [-Sd] \olabel{Sd} Tells the compiler to be Delphi compatible. Deprecated, use
\var{-Mdelphi} instead. 
\item [-SeN] \olabel{Se} The compiler stops after the N-th error. Normally,
the compiler tries to continue compiling after an error, until 50 errors are
reached, or a fatal error is reached, and then it stops. With this switch,
the compiler will stop after the N-th error (if N is omitted, a default of 1
is assumed). Instead of a number, one of \var{n}, \var{h} or \var{w} can also be specified, in that case the compiler will consider notes, hints or warnings as errors and stop when one is encountered.
\item [-Sg] \olabel{Sg} Support the \var{label} and \var{goto} commands. By
default these are not supported. You must also specify this option if you
use labels in assembler statements. (if you use the \var{AT\&T} style
assember)
\item [-Sh] Use ansistrings by default for strings. If this keyword is
specified, the compiler will interpret the \var{string} keyword as a
ansistring. Otherwise it is supposed to be a short strings (TP style).
\item [-Si] \olabel{Si} Support \var{C++} style INLINE.
\item [-SIXXX] set interfaces style to XXX.
\item [-Sm] \olabel{Sm} Support C-style macros.

\var{-Mtp} instead.
\item [-Sp] \olabel{Sp} Try to be \file{gpc} (\gnu pascal compiler)
compatible. Deprecated, use \var{-Mgpc} instead.
\item [-Ss] \olabel{Ss} The name of constructors must be \var{init}, and the
name of destructors should be \var{done}.
\item [-St] \olabel{St} Allow the \var{static} keyword in objects.
\item [-Un] \olabel{Un} Do not check the unit name. Normally, the unit name
is the same as the filename. This option allows both to be different.
\item [-Us] \olabel{Us} Compile a system unit. This option causes the
compiler to define only some very basic types.
\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Using the configuration file
\section{Using the configuration file}
\label{se:configfile}
Using the configuration file \file{fpc.cfg} is an alternative to command
line options. When a configuration file is found, it is read, and the lines
in it are treated like you typed them on the command line. They are treated
before the options that you type on the command line.

You can specify comments in the configuration file with the \var{\#} sign.
Everything from the \var{\#} on will be ignored.

The algorithm to determine which file is used as a configuration file
is decribed in \ref{searchconfig} on page \pageref{searchconfig}.

When the compiler has finished reading the configuration file, it continues
to treat the command line options.

One of the command-line options allows you to specify a second configuration
file: Specifying \file{@foo} on the command line will open file \file{foo},
and read further options from there. When the compiler has finished reading
this file, it continues to process the command line.

The configuration file allows some kind of preprocessing. It understands the
following directives, which you should place on the first column of a line :
\begin{description}
\item [\#IFDEF]
\item [\#IFNDEF]
\item [\#ELSE]
\item [\#ENDIF]
\item [\#DEFINE]
\item [\#UNDEF]
\item [\#WRITE]
\item [\#INCLUDE]
\item [\#SECTION]
\end{description}
They work the same way as their \{\$...\}  counterparts in Pascal. All the default
defines used to compile source code are also defined while processing the configuration
file. For example, if the target compiler is an intel 80x86 compatile linux platform,
both \var{cpu86} and \var{linux} will be defined while interpreting the configuration
file. For the possible default defines when compiling, consult Appendix G of the \progref.


What follows is a description of the different directives.

\subsection{\#IFDEF}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#IFDEF name
\end{verbatim}
Lines following \var{\#IFDEF} are skipped read if the keyword \var{name}
following it is not defined.

They are read until the keywords \var{\#ELSE} or \var{\#ENDIF} are
encountered, after which normal processing is resumed.

Example :
\begin{verbatim}
#IFDEF VER0_99_5
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.5/linuxunits
#ENDIF
\end{verbatim}
In the above example, \file{/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.5/linuxunits} will be added to
the path if you're compiling with version 0.99.5 of the compiler.

\subsection{\#IFNDEF}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#IFNDEF name
\end{verbatim}
Lines following \var{\#IFNDEF} are skipped read if the keyword \var{name}
following it is defined.

They are read until the keywords \var{\#ELSE} or \var{\#ENDIF} are
encountered, after which normal processing is resumed.

Example :
\begin{verbatim}
#IFNDEF VER0_99_5
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.6/linuxunits
#ENDIF
\end{verbatim}
In the above example, \file{/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.6/linuxunits} will be added to
the path if you're NOT compiling with version 0.99.5 of the compiler.

\subsection{\#ELSE}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#ELSE
\end{verbatim}
\var{\#ELSE} can be specified after a \var{\#IFDEF} or \var{\#IFNDEF}
directive as an alternative.
Lines following \var{\#ELSE} are skipped read if the preceding \var{\#IFDEF}
or \var{\#IFNDEF} was accepted.

They are skipped until the keyword \var{\#ENDIF} is
encountered, after which normal processing is resumed.

Example :
\begin{verbatim}
#IFDEF VER0_99_5
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.5/linuxunits
#ELSE
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.6/linuxunits
#ENDIF
\end{verbatim}
In the above example, \file{/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.5/linuxunits} will be added to
the path if you're compiling with version 0.99.5 of the compiler,
otherwise \file{/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.6/linuxunits} will be added to the path.

\subsection{\#ENDIF}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#ENDIF
\end{verbatim}
\var{\#ENDIF} marks the end of a block that started with \var{\#IF(N)DEF},
possibly with an \var{\#ELSE} between it.

\subsection{\#DEFINE}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#DEFINE name
\end{verbatim}
\var{\#DEFINE} defines a new keyword. This has the same effect as a
\var{-dname}  command-line option.

\subsection{\#UNDEF}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#UNDEF name
\end{verbatim}
\var{\#UNDEF} un-defines a keyword if it existed.
This has the same effect as a \var{-uname}  command-line option.

\subsection{\#WRITE}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#WRITE Message Text
\end{verbatim}
\var{\#WRITE} writes \var{Message Text} to the screen.
This can be useful to display warnings if certain options are set.

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
#IFDEF DEBUG
#WRITE Setting debugging ON...
-g
#ENDIF
\end{verbatim}
if \var{DEBUG} is defined, this will produce a line
\begin{verbatim}
Setting debugging ON...
\end{verbatim}
and will then switch on debugging information in the compiler.

\subsection{\#INCLUDE}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#INCLUDE filename
\end{verbatim}
\var{\#INCLUDE} instructs the compiler to read the contents of
\file{filename} before continuing to process options in the current file.

This can be useful if you want to have a particular configuration file
for a project (or, under \linux, in your home directory), but still want to
have the global options that are set in a global configuration file.

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
#IFDEF LINUX
  #INCLUDE /etc/fpc.cfg
#ELSE
  #IFDEF GO32V2
    #INCLUDE c:\pp\bin\fpc.cfg
  #ENDIF
#ENDIF
\end{verbatim}
This will include \file{/etc/fpc.cfg} if you're on a linux machine,
and will include \verb+c:\pp\bin\fpc.cfg+
on a dos machine.

\subsection{\#SECTION}
Syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
#SECTION name
\end{verbatim}
The \var{\#SECTION} directive acts as a \var{\#IFDEF} directive, only
it doesn't require an \var{\#ENDIF} directive. the special name \var{COMMON}
always exists, i.e. lines following \var{\#SECTION COMMON} are always read.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Variable subsitution in paths
\section{Variable substitution in paths}
To avoid having to edit your configuration files too often,
the compiler allows you to specify the following variables in
the paths that you feed to the compiler:
\begin{description}
\item[FPCFULLVERSION] is replaced by the compiler's version string.
\item[FPCVERSION] is replaced by the compiler's version string.
\item[FPCDATE] is replaced by the compiler's date.
\item[FPCTARGET] is replaced by the compiler's target (combination of CPU-OS)
\item[FPCCPU] is also replaced by the compiler's target CPU.
\item[FPCOS] is replaced by the compiler's target OS.
\end{description}
To have these variables subsituted, just insert them with a \var{\$}
prepended, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$FPCVERSION/rtl/$FPCOS
\end{verbatim}
This is equivalent to
\begin{verbatim}
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12a/rtl/linux
\end{verbatim}
If the compiler version is \var{0.99.12a} and the target os is \var{linux}.

These replacemens are valid on the command-line and also in the
configuration file.

On the linux command-line, you must be careful to escape the \var{\$} since
otherwise the shell will expand the variable for you, which may have
undesired effects.

\chapter{Porting and Portable code }


\section{Turbo Pascal}
\fpc was originally designed to resemble Turbo Pascal as closely as possible. 
There are, of course, restrictions. Some of these are due to the fact that \fpc is
a 32-bit compiler. Other restrictions result from the fact that \fpc works
on more than one operating system.

In general we can say that if you keep your program code close to ANSI
Pascal, you will have no problems porting from Turbo Pascal, or even Delphi, to
\fpc. To a large extent, the constructs defined by Turbo Pascal are
supported. This is even more so if you use the \var{-So} or \var{-S2}
switches.

In the following sections we will list the Turbo Pascal and Delphi 
constructs which are not supported in \fpc, and we will list in what
ways \fpc extends the Turbo Pascal.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Things that will not work
\subsection{Things that will not work}

Here we give a list of things which are defined/allowed in Turbo Pascal, but
which are not supported by \fpc. Where possible, we indicate the reason.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Duplicate case labels are not allowed. This is a bug in Turbo Pascal
and will not be changed.
\item Parameter lists of previously defined functions and procedures must
match exactly. The reason for this is the function overloading mechanism of
\fpc. (however, the \seeo{M} option solves this.)
\item The \var{MEM, MEMW, MEML} and \var{PORT} variables for memory and port
access are not available in the system unit. This is due to the operating system. Under
\dos, the extender unit (\file {GO32.PPU}) implements the mem constuct.
under \linux, the \file{ports} unit implements such a construct.
\item There are more reserved words. \var{PROTECTED, PUBLIC, PUBLISHED, TRY, FINALLY, EXCEPT, RAISE}
are reserved words. This means you cannot create procedures or variables
with the same name. While they are not reserved words in Turbo Pascal,
they are in Delphi. Using the \var{-Mtp} switch will solve this problem if
you want to compile Turbo Pascal code that uses these words
(\seec{reserved} for a list of all reserved words).

\item The reserved words \var{FAR, NEAR} are ignored. This is
because \fpc is a 32 bit compiler, so they're obsolete.
\item \var{INTERRUPT} will work only on the \dos target.
\item By default the compiler uses  \var{AT\&T} assembler syntax.
This is mainly because \fpc uses \gnu \var{as}. However, other assembler
forms are available. For more information, see \progref.
\item Turbo Vision is available under the name of FreeVision, which should
be almost 100\% compatible with Turbo Vision.
\item The 'overlay' unit is not available. It also isn't necessary, since
\fpc is a 32 bit compiler, so program size shouldn't be a point.
\item There are more reserved words. (see appendix \ref{ch:reserved} for a
list of all reserved words.)
\item The command-line parameters of the compiler are different.
\item Compiler switches and directives are mostly the same, but some extra
exist.
\item Units are not binary compatible.
\item Sets are always 4 bytes in Free Pascal; this means that some typecasts
which were possible in Turbo Pascal are no longer possible in Free Pascal.
\item A file is opened for output only (using \var{fmOutput}) when it is
opened with \var{Rewrite}. In order to be able to read from it, it should
be reset with \var{Reset}.
\item Destructors cannot have parameters. This restriction can be solved by
using the \var{-So} switch.
\item There can be only one destructor. This restriction can also be
solved by using the \var{-So} switch.
\item The order in which expressions are evaluated is not necessarily the
same. In the following expression:
\begin{verbatim}
a := g(2) + f(3);
\end{verbatim}
it is not guaranteed that \var{g(2)} will be evaluated before \var{f(3)}.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Things which are extra
\subsection{Things which are extra}
Here we give a list of things which are possible in \fpc, but which
didn't exist in Turbo Pascal or Delphi.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Functions can also return complex types, such as records and arrays.
\item You can handle function results in the function itself, as a variable.
Example
\begin{verbatim}
function a : longint;

begin
   a:=12;
   while a>4 do
     begin
        {...}
     end;
end;
\end{verbatim}
The example above would work with TP, but the compiler would assume
that the \var{a>4} is a recursive call. To do a recursive call in
this you must append \var{()} behind the function name:
\begin{verbatim}
function a : longint;

begin
   a:=12;
   { this is the recursive call }
   if a()>4 then
     begin
        {...}
     end;
end;
\end{verbatim}
\item There is partial support of Delphi constructs. (see the \progref for
more information on this).
\item The \var{exit} call accepts a return value for functions.
\begin{verbatim}
function a : longint;

begin
   a:=12;
   if a>4 then
     begin
        exit(a*67); {function result upon exit is a*67 }
     end;
end;
\end{verbatim}
\item \fpc supports function overloading. That is, you can define many
functions with the same name, but with different arguments. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
procedure DoSomething (a : longint);
begin
{...}
end;

procedure DoSomething (a : real);
begin
{...}
end;
\end{verbatim}
You can then call procedure \var{DoSomething} with an argument of type
\var{Longint} or \var{Real}.\\
This feature has the consequence that a previously declared function must
always be defined with the header completely the same:
\begin{verbatim}
procedure x (v : longint); forward;

{...}

procedure x;{ This will overload the previously declared x}
begin
{...}
end;
\end{verbatim}
This construction will generate a compiler error, because the compiler
didn't find a definition of \var{procedure x (v : longint);}. Instead you
should define your procedure x as:
\begin{verbatim}
procedure x (v : longint);
{ This correctly defines the previously declared x}
begin
{...}
end;
\end{verbatim}
(The \seeo{So} switch disables overloading. When you use it, the above will
compile, as in Turbo Pascal.
\item Operator overloading. \fpc allows to overload operators, i.e. you can
define e.g. the '+' operator for matrices.
\item On FAT16 and FAT32 systems, long file names are supported.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Turbo Pascal compatibility mode
\subsection{Turbo Pascal compatibility mode}
When you compile a program with the \var{-Mtp} switch, the compiler will
attempt to mimic the Turbo Pascal compiler in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assigning a procedural variable doesn't require a @ operator. One of
the differences between Turbo Pascal and \fpc is that the latter requires
you to specify an address operator when assigning a value to a procedural
variable. In Turbo Pascal compatibility mode, this is not required.
\item Procedure overloading is disabled. If procedure overloading is
disabled, the function header doesn't need to repeat the function header.

\item Forward defined procedures don't need the full parameter list when
they are defined. Due to the procedure overloading feature of \fpc, you must
always specify the parameter list of a function when you define it, even
when it was declared earlier with \var{Forward}. In Turbo Pascal
compatibility mode, there is no function overloading, hence you can omit the
parameter list:
\begin{verbatim}
Procedure a (L : Longint); Forward;

...

Procedure a ; { No need to repeat the (L : Longint) }

begin
 ...
end;

\end{verbatim}
\item recursive function calls are handled differently. Consider the
following example :
\begin{verbatim}
Function expr : Longint;

begin
  ...
  Expr:=L:
  Writeln (Expr);
  ...
end;
\end{verbatim}
In Turbo Pascal compatibility mode, the function will be called recursively
when the \var{writeln} statement is processed. In \fpc, the function result
will be printed. In order to call the function recusively under \fpc, you
need to implement it as follows :
\begin{verbatim}
Function expr : Longint;

begin
  ...
  Expr:=L:
  Writeln (Expr());
  ...
end;
\end{verbatim}
\item Any text after the final \var{End.} statement is ignored. Normally,
this text is processed too.
\item You cannot assign procedural variables to untyped pointers; so the
following is invalid:
\begin{verbatim}
 a: Procedure;
 b: Pointer;
begin
 b := a; // Error will be generated.
\end{verbatim}
\item The @ operator is typed when applied on procedures.
\item You cannot nest comments.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A note about long file names.
\subsection{A note on long file names under \dos}
Under \windows 95 and higher, long filenames are supported. Compiling
for the win32 target ensures that long filenames are supported in all
functions that do file or disk access in any way.

Moreover, \fpc supports the use of long filenames in the system unit and
the dos unit also for go32v2 executables. The system unit contains the
boolean variable \var{LFNsupport}. If it is set to \var{True} then all
system unit functions and DOS unit functions will use long file names
if they are available. This should be so on \windows 95 and 98, but
not on \windows NT or \windows 2000. The system unit will check this 
by calling \dos function \var{71A0h} and checking whether long filenames 
are supported on the \file{C:} drive.

It is possible to disable the long filename support by setting the
\var{LFNSupport} variable to \var{False}; but in general it is recommended
to compile programs that need long filenames as native Win32 applications;

\section{Porting Delphi Code}

Porting Delphi code should be quite painless. The \var{Delphi} mode of the 
compiler tries to mimic Delphi as closely as possible. 
This mode can be enabled using the \var{-Mdelphi} command line switch, 
or by inserting the following code in the sources before the \var{unit} 
or \var{program} clause
\begin{verbatim}
{$IFDEF FPC}
{$MODE DELPHI}
{$ENDIF FPC}
\end{verbatim}
This ensures that the code will still compile with both Delphi and FPC.

Nevertheless, there are some things that will not work. 
Delphi compatibility is relatively complete up to Delphi 7. 
New constructs in higher versions of Delphi 
(notably, the versions that work with .NET) are not supported.

\subsection{Missing language constructs}
At the level of language compatibility, FPC is very compatible with Delphi:
it can compile most of FreeCLX, the free Widget library that was shipped 
with Delphi 6,7 and Kylix.

Currently, the only missing language constructs are
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \var{Dispinterface} interface.
\item Delegation of interfaces is not supported.
\item \var{Dynamic} methods are actually the same as \var{virtual}.
\item \var{Reintroduce} is not supported.
\item \var{Const} for a parameter to a procedure does not necessarily 
mean that the variable or value is passed by reference.
\item Packages are not supported.
\end{enumerate}

There are some inline assembler constructs which are not supported, 
but since \fpc is designed to be platform independent, it is quite 
unlikely that these constructs will be supported in the future.

Note that the \var{-Mobjfpc} mode switch is to a large degree Delphi 
compatible, but is more strict than Delphi. The most notable differences
are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parameters or local variables of methods cannot have the same 
names as properties of the class in which they are implemented.
\item The address operator is needed when assigning procedural variables (or event handlers).
\item AnsiStrings are not switched on by default.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Missing calls/API incompatibilities}
Delphi is heavily bound to Windows. Because of this, it has introduces a lot of Windows-isms in the API (e.g. file searching and opening, loading libraries).

\fpc was designed to be portable, so things that are very Windows 
specific are missing, although the \fpc team tries to minimize this.
The following are the main points that should be considered:

\begin{itemize}
\item By default, \fpc generates console applications. This means that
you must explicitly enable the GUI application type for windows:
\begin{verbatim}
{$APPTYPE GUI}
\end{verbatim}
\item The \file{Windows} unit provides access to most of the core 
Win32 API. Some calls may have different parameter lists: instead 
of declaring a parameter as passed by reference (var), a pointer 
is used (as in C). For most cases, \fpc provides overloaded versions 
of such calls.
\item Widestrings. Widestring management is not automatic in \fpc, since various platforms have different ways of dealing with widestring encodings and Multi-Byte Character Sets. FPC supports Widestrings, but may not use the same encoding as on Windows.
\item Threads: At this moment, \fpc does not offer native thread 
management on all platforms; on Unix, linking to the C library is 
needed to provide thread management in an FPC application. 
This means that a \file{cthreads} unit must be included to enable 
threads.
\item a much-quoted example is the \var{SetLastOSError} call. 
This is not supported, and will never be supported.
\item Filename Case sensitivity: Pascal is a case-insensitive language,
so the uses clause should also be case insensitive. Free Pascal ensures
case insensitive filenames by also searching for a lowercase version 
of the file. Kylix does not do this, so this could create problems
if 2 differently cased versions of the same filename are in the path.
\item RTTI is NOT stored in the same way as for Delphi. The format is mostly compatible, but may differ. This should not be a problem if the API of the TypeInfo unit 
is used and no direct access to the RTTI information is attempted.
\item Sets are of different size than in Delphi.
\item Enumerateds are of different size than in Delphi.
\item In general, one should not make assumptions about the internal
structure of complex types such as records, objects, classes and their
associated structure: For example the VMT table layout is different, the
alignment of fields in a record may be different, etc. 
\item The same is true for basic types: on other processors the high and low
bytes of a word or integer may not be on the same location as on an Intel
processor (the endianness is different).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Best practices for porting}

When encountering differences in Delphi/FPC calls, the best thing to 
do is not to insert IFDEF statements whenever a difference is 
encountered, but to create a separate unit which is only used 
when compiling with FPC. The missing/incompatible calls can 
then be implemented in that unit. This will keep the code more 
readable and easier to maintain.

If a language construct difference is found, then the \fpc team 
should be contacted and a bug should be reported.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% writing portable code
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Writing portable code}

\fpc is designed to be cross-platform. This means that the basic RTL 
units are usable on all platforms, and the compiler behaves the same 
on all platforms (as far as possible).  The Object Pascal 
langauge is the same on all platforms. Nevertheless, FPC comes with a
lot of units that are not portable, but provide access to all 
possibilities that a platform provides.

The following are some guidelines to consider when writing portable code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid system-specific units. The system unit, the objects and 
classes units and the SysUtils unit are guaranteed to work on all 
systems. So is the DOS unit, but that is deprecated. 
\item Avoid direct hardware access. Limited, console-like Hardware 
access is available for most platforms in the Video, Mouse and  
Keyboard units.
\item Do not use hard-coded filename conventions. 
See below for more information on this.
\item Make no assumptions on the internal representation of types. Various
processors store information in different ways ('endianness').
\item If system-specific functionality is needed, it is best to 
separate this out in a single unit. Porting efforts will then be 
limited to re-implementing this unit for the new platform.
\item Don't use assembler, unless you have to. Assembler is processor
specific. Some instructions will not work even on the same processor family.
\item Do not assume that pointers and integers have the same size. They do
on an intel 32-bit processor, but not necesarily on other processors.
The \var{PtrInt} type is an alias for the integer type that has the same
size as a pointer. \var{SizeInt} is used for all size-related issues.
\end{itemize}

The system unit contains some constants which describe file access on a system:
\begin{description}
\item[LineEnding] A character or string which describes the end-of-line marker used on the current platform. Commonly, this is one of \#10, \#13\#10 or \#13.
\item[LFNSupport] A boolean that indicates whether the system supports long filenames
(i.e. is not limited to MS-DOS 8.3 filenames).
\item[DirectorySeparator] is the character which acts as a separator between directory parts of a path.
\item[DriveSeparator] for systems that supports driveletters, this is the character that
is used to separate the drive indication from the path..
\item[PathSeparator] the character used to separate items in a list (notably, a PATH).
\item[maxExitCode] The maximum value for a process exitcode.
\item[MaxPathLen] The maximum length of a filename, including a path.
\item[FileNameCaseSensitive] a boolean that indicates whether filenames are handled case sensitively.
\item[UnusedHandle] a value used to indicate an unused/invalid file handle.
\item[StdInputHandle] the value of the standard input file handle. This is not always zero, as is commonly the case on Unices.
\item[StdOutputHandle] the value of the standard input file handle. This is not always 1, as is commonly the case on Unices.
\item[StdErrorHandle] the value of the standard input file handle. This is not always 2, as is commonly the case on Unices.
\item[CtrlZMarksEOF] a boolean that indicates whether the \#26 character marks the end of a file.
(an old MS-DOS convention)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Utilities.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Utilities that come with Free Pascal}
\label{ch:Utilities}
Besides the compiler and the Run-Time Library, \fpc comes with some utility
programs and units. Here we list these programs and units.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Demo programs and examples.
\section{Demo programs and examples}
Also distributed with \fpc comes a series of demonstration programs.
These programs have no other purpose than demonstrating the capabilities of
\fpc. They are located in the \file{demo} directory of the sources.

All example programs of the documentation are available. Check out the
directories that end on \file{ex} in the documentation sources. There you
will find all example sources.

\section{fpcmake}

\file{fpcmake} is the \fpc makefile constructor program.

It reads a \file{Makefile.fpc} configuration file and converts it to a
\file{Makefile} suitable for reading by GNU \file{make} to compile
your projects. It is similar in functionality to GNU \file{autoconf}
or \file{Imake} for making X projects.

\file{fpcmake} accepts filenames of makefile description files as its
command-line arguments. For each of these files it will create a
\file{Makefile} in the same directory where the file is located,
overwriting any other existing file.

If no options are given, it just attempts to read the file \file{Makefile.fpc}
in the current directory and tries to construct a makefile from it.
any previously existing \file{Makefile} will be erased.

The format of the \file{fpcmake} configuration file is described in great
detail in the appendices of the \progref.

\section{fpdoc - Pascal Unit documenter}

\file{fpdoc} is a program which generates fully cross-referenced
documentation for a unit. It generates documentation for each 
identifier found in the unit's interface section. The generated 
documentation can be in many formats for instance HTML and LaTeX. 
Unlike other documentation tools, the documentation can be in a separate
file (in XML format), so the sources aren't cluttered with documentation.
It's companion program \file{makeskel} creates an empty XML file with
entries for all identifiers.

\file{fpdoc} and \file{makeskel} are described in \fpdocref.

\section{h2pas - C header to Pascal Unit converter}
\file{h2pas} attempts to convert a C header file to a pascal unit. 
it can handle most C constructs that one finds in a C header file,
and attempts to translate them to their pascal counterparts. see below
(constructs) for a full description of what the translator can handle.
The unit with pascal declarations can then be used to access code written in C.

The output of the h2pas program is written to a file with the same name as
the C header file that was used as input, but with the extension \file{.pp}
The output file that h2pas creates can be customized in a number of ways by
means of many options.

\subsection{Options}
The output of  \file{h2pas} can be controlled with the following options:

\begin{description}
\item[-d] use \var{external;} for all procedure and function declarations.
\item[-D] use \var{external libname name 'func\_name'} for function and 
procedure declarations.
\item[-e] Emit a series of constants instead of an enumeration type for the 
C \var{enum} construct. 
\item[-i] create an include file instead of a unit (omits the unit header).
\item[-l] \textbf{libname} specify the library name for external function 
declarations.
\item[-o] \textbf{outfile} Specify the output file name. Default is the input file name with 
the extension replaced by \file{.pp}
\item[-p] use the letter \var{P} in front of pointer type parameters instead of \^.
\item[-s] Strip comments from the input file. By default comments are converted
to comments, but they may be displaced, since a comment is handled by the
scanner.
\item[-t] prepend typedef type names with the letter \var{T} (used to follow 
Borland's convention that all types should be defined with T).
\item[-v] replace pointer parameters by call by reference parameters.
Use with care because some calls can expect a \var{Nil} pointer.
\item[-w] Header file is a win32 header file (adds support for some special macros).
\item[-x] handle SYS\_TRAP of the PalmOS header files.
\end{description}

\subsection{Constructs}
The following C declarations and statements are recognized:

\begin{description}
\item[defines] 
defines are changed into pascal constants if they are simple defines.
macros are changed - wherever possible to functions; however the arguments
are all integers, so these must be changed manually. Simple expressions 
in define staments are recognized, as are most arithmetic operators: 
addition, substraction, multiplication, division, logical operators, 
comparision operators, shift operators. The C construct ( A ? B : C)
is also recognized and translated to a pascal construct with an IF
statement (this is buggy, however).

\item[preprocessor statements]
the conditional preprocessing commands are recognized and translated into
equivalent pascal compiler directives. The special 
\begin{verbatim}
#ifdef __cplusplus
\end{verbatim}
is also recognized and removed.
\item[typedef] A typedef statement is changed into a pascal type statement. 
The following basic types are recognized:
\begin{itemize}
\item \var{char} changed to \var{char}.
\item \var{float} changed to \var{real} (=double in \fpc).
\item \var{int} changed to \var{longint}.
\item \var{long} changed to \var{longint}.
\item \var{long int} changed to \var{longint}.
\item \var{short} changed to \var{integer}. 
\item \var{unsigned} changed to \var{cardinal}.
\item \var{unsigned char} changed to \var{byte}.
\item \var{unsigned int} changed to \var{cardinal}.
\item \var{unsigned long int} changed to \var{cardinal}.
\item \var{unsigned short} changed to \var{word}.
\item \var{void} ignored.
\end{itemize}
These types are also changed if they appear in the arguments of a function
or procedure.
\item[functions and procedures]
functions and procedures are translated as well; pointer types may be
changed to call by reference arguments (using the \var{var} argument) 
by using the \var{-p} command line argument. functions that have a 
variable number of arguments are changed to a function with an 
\var{array of const} argument.
\item[specifiers]
The \var{extern} specifier is recognized; however it is ignored. the
\var{packed} specifier is also recognised and changed with the
\var{PACKRECORDS} directive. The \var{const} specifier is also 
recognized, but is ignored.
\item[modifiers] 
If the \var{-w} option is specified, then the following modifiers are recognized:
\begin{verbatim}
STDCALL
CDECL
CALLBACK
PASCAL
WINAPI
APIENTRY
WINGDIAPI
\end{verbatim}
as defined in the win32 headers. If additionally the \var{-x}
option is specified then the  
\begin{verbatim}
SYS_TRAP
\end{verbatim}
specifier is also recognized.
\item[enums]
enum constructs are changed into enumeration types; bear in mind that in C
enumeration types can have values assigned to them; Free Pascal also allows
this to a certain degree. If you know that values are assigned to enums, it
is best to use the \var{-e} option to change the enus to a series of integer 
constants.

\item[unions] unions are changed to variant records. 
\item[structs] are changed to pascal records, with C packing.
\end{description}

\section{h2paspp - preprocessor for h2pas}
\var{h2paspp} can be used as a simple preprocessor for \file{h2pas}. It
removes some of the constructs that h2pas has difficulties with. 
\file{h2paspp} reads one or more C header files and preprocesses them, writing the result 
to files with the same name as the originals as it goes along. 
It does not accept all preprocesser tokens of C, but takes care of the following 
preprocessor directives:

\begin{description}
\item [\#define symbol] Defines the new symbol \var{symbol}. Note that macros are not supported.
\item [\#if symbol] The text following this directive is included if \var{symbol} is defined.
\item [\#ifdef symbol] The text following this directive is included if \var{symbol} is defined. 
\item [\#ifndef symbol] The text following this directive is included if \var{symbol} is not defined.
\item [\#include filename] Include directives are removed, unless the \var{-I} option was given, 
in which case the include file is included and written to the output file.
\item[\#undef symbol] The symbol \var{symbol} is undefined.
\end{description}

\subsection{Usage}
\file{h2paspp} accepts one or more filenames and preprocesses them. 
It will read the input, and write output to a file with the same name 
unless the \var{-o} option is given, in which case the file is written 
to the specified file. Note that only one output filename can be given.


\subsection{Options}
\file{h2paspp} has a small number of options to control its behaviour:
\begin{description}
\item[-dsymbol] Define the symbol \var{symbol} before processing is started.
\item[-h] emit a small helptext.
\item[-I] include include files instead of dropping the include statement.
\item[-ooutfile] If this option is given, the output will be written to a 
file named \file{outfile}. Note that only one output file can be given.
\end{description}

\section{ppudump program}

\file{ppudump} is a program which shows the contents of a \fpc unit. It
is distributed with the compiler. You can just issue the following command
\begin{verbatim}
  ppudump [options] foo.ppu
\end{verbatim}
to display the contents of the \file{foo.ppu} unit. You can specify multiple
files on the command line.

The options can be used to change the verbosity of the display. By default,
all available information is displayed.
You can set the verbosity level using the \var{-Vxxx} option.
Here, \var{xxx} is a combination of the following
letters:
\begin{description}
\item [h:\ ] show header info.
\item [i:\ ] show interface information.
\item [m:\ ] show implementation information.
\item [d:\ ] show only (interface) definitions.
\item [s:\ ] show only (interface) symbols.
\item [b:\ ] show browser info.
\item [a:\ ] show everything (default if no -V option is present).
\end{description}


\section{ppumove program}
\label{se:ppumove}

\file{ppumove} is a program to make shared or static libraries from
multiple units. It can be compared with the \file{tpumove} program that
comes with
Turbo Pascal.

It should be distributed in binary form along with the compiler.

Its usage is very simple:
\begin{verbatim}
ppumove [options] unit1.ppu unit2.ppu ... unitn.ppu
\end{verbatim}
Where \var{options} is a combination of
\begin{description}
\item[-b:\ ] If specified, ppumve will generate a batch file that will
contain the external linking and archiving commands that must be
executed. The name of this batch file is \file{pmove.sh} on \linux, and
\file{pmove.bat} otherwise.
\item[-d xxx:\ ] If specified, the output files will put in the directory
\file{xxx}
\item[-e xxx:\ ] Sets the extension of the moved unit files to \file{xxx}.
By default, this is \file{.ppl}. You don't have to specify the dot.
\item[-o xxx:\ ] sets the name of the output file, i.e. the name of the file
containing all the units. This parameter is mandatory when you use multiple
files. On \linux, \file{ppumove} will prepend this name with \file{lib} if it isn't
already there, and will add an extension appropriate to the type of library.
\item [-q:\ ] Causes \file{ppumove} to operate silently.
\item [-s:\ ] Tells \file{ppumove} to make a static library instead of a
dynamic one; By default a dynamic library is made on \linux.
\item [-w:\ ] Tells ppumove that it is working under \windowsnt. This will
change the names of te linker and archiving program to \file{ldw} and
\file{arw}, respectively.
\item[-h or -?:\ ] will display a short help.
\end{description}

The action of the ppumve program is as follows:
It takes each of the unit files, and modifies it so that the compile will
know that it should look for the unit code in the library. The new unit
files will have an extension \file{.ppu}, this can be changed with the
\var{-e} option. It will then put together all the object files of the units
into one library, static or dynamic, depending on the presence of the
\var{-s} option.

The name of this library must be set with the \var{-o} option.
If needed, the prefix \file{lib} will be prepended under \linux..
The extension will be set to \file{.a} for static libraries,
for shared libraries the extensions are \var{.so} on linux, and \var{.dll}
under \windowsnt and \ostwo.

As an example, the following command
\begin{verbatim}
./ppumove -o both -e ppl ppu.ppu timer.ppu
\end{verbatim}
under linux, will generate the following output:
\begin{verbatim}
PPU-Mover Version 0.99.7
Copyright (c) 1998 by the Free Pascal Development Team

Processing ppu.ppu... Done.
Processing timer.ppu... Done.
Linking timer.o ppu.o
Done.
\end{verbatim}
And it will produce the following files:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \file{libboth.so} : The shared library containing the code from
\file{ppu.o} and \file{timer.o}. Under \windowsnt, this file would be called
\file{both.dll}.
\item \file{timer.ppl} : The unit file that tells the \fpc compiler to look
for the timer code in the library.
\item \file{ppu.ppl} : The unit file that tells the \fpc compiler to look
for the timer code in the library.
\end{enumerate}
You could then use or distribute the files \file{libboth.so}, \file{timer.ppl}
and \file{ppu.ppl}.

\section{ptop - Pascal source beautifier}

\subsection{ptop program}
% This section was supplied by Marco Van de voort, for which my thanks.
% I did some cleaning, and added the subsubsection with help on on the
% object. MVC.

\file{ptop} is a source beautifier written by Peter Grogono based on the ancient pretty-printer
by Ledgard, Hueras, and Singer, modernized by the \fpc team (objects, streams, configurability etc)

This configurability, and the thorough bottom-up design are the advantages of this program over
the diverse TurboPascal sourcebeautifiers on e.g. SIMTEL.

The program is quite simple to operate:

ptop "[-v] [-i indent] [-b bufsize ][-c \file{optsfile}] \file{infile} \file{outfile}"

The \file{Infile} parameter is the pascal file to be processed, and will be written
to \file{outfile}, overwriting an existing \file{outfile} if it exists.

Some options modify the behaviour of ptop:

\begin{description}
\item[-h] Writes an overview of the possible parameters and commandline syntax.
\item[-c \file{ptop.cfg}] Read some configuration data from configuration file instead of using
  the internal defaults then. A config file is not required, the program can
  operate without one. See also -g.
\item[-i ident] Sets the number of indent spaces used for BEGIN END; and other blocks.
\item[-b bufsize] Sets the streaming buffersize to bufsize. Default 255, 0 is considered non-valid and ignored.
\item[-v] be verbose. Currently only outputs the number of lines read/written and some error messages.
\item[-g \file{ptop.cfg}] Writes a default configuration file to be edited to the file "ptop.cfg"
\end{description}

\subsection{The ptop configuration file}

Creating and distributing a configuration file for ptop is not necesarry,
unless you want to modify the standard behaviour of \file{ptop}. The configuration
file is never preloaded, so if you want to use it you should always specify
it with a \var{-c ptop.cfg} parameter.

The structure of a ptop configuration file is a simple buildingblock repeated
several (20-30) times, for each pascal keyword known to the \file{ptop} program.
(see the default configuration file or \file{ptopu.pp} source to
find out which keywords are known)

The basic building block of the configuration file consists out of one or two
lines, describing how \file{ptop} should react on a certain keyword.
First a line without square brackets with the following format:

keyword=option1,option2,option3,...

If one of the options is "dindonkey" (see further below), a second line
(with square brackets) is needed like this:

[keyword]=otherkeyword1,otherkeyword2,otherkeyword3,...

As you can see the block contains two types of identifiers, keywords(keyword and otherkeyword1..3 in above example)
and options, (option1..3 above).

\var{Keywords} are the built-in valid Pascal structure-identifiers like BEGIN, END, CASE, IF,
THEN, ELSE, IMPLEMENTATION. The default configuration file lists most of these.

Besides the real Pascal keywords, some other codewords are used for operators
and comment expressions. \seet{keywords}

\begin{FPCltable}{lll}{keywords for operators}{keywords}
Name of codeword       &     operator \\  \hline
casevar                &     : in a case label ( unequal 'colon') \\
becomes                &     := \\
delphicomment          &     // \\
opencomment            &       \{ or (* \\
closecomment           &     \} or *) \\
semicolon              &     ; \\
colon                  &     : \\
equals                 &     = \\
openparen              &     [ \\
closeparen             &     ] \\
period                 &     . \\
\end{FPCltable}

The \textbf{Options} codewords define actions to be taken when the keyword before
the equal sign is found, \seet{ptopoptions}

\begin{FPCltable}{lll}{Possible options}{ptopoptions}
Option         &     does what \\ \hline
crsupp         &     suppress CR before the keyword.\\
crbefore       &     force CR before keyword\\
               &     (doesn't go with crsupp :) )\\
blinbefore     &     blank line before keyword.\\
dindonkey      &     de-indent on associated keywords\\
               &     (see below)\\
dindent        &     deindent (always)\\
spbef          &     space before\\
spaft          &     space after\\
gobsym         &     Print symbols which follow a\\
               &     keyword but which do not\\
               &     affect layout. prints until\\
               &     terminators occur.\\
               &     (terminators are hard-coded in pptop,\\
               &     still needs changing)\\
inbytab        &     indent by tab.\\
crafter        &     force CR after keyword.\\
upper          &     prints keyword all uppercase\\
lower          &     prints keyword all lowercase\\
capital        &     capitalizes keyword: 1st letter\\
               &     uppercase, rest lowercase.\\
\end{FPCltable}

The option "dindonkey" requires some extra parameters, which are
set by a second line for that option (the one with the square brackets), which is
therefore is only needed if the options contain "dinkdonkey" (contraction of
de-indent on assiociated keyword).

"dinkdonkey" deindents if any of the keywords specified by the extra options of the
square-bracket line is found.

Example: The lines

\begin{verbatim}
else=crbefore,dindonkey,inbytab,upper
[else]=if,then,else
\end{verbatim}

mean the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The keyword this block is about is \textbf{else} because it's on the LEFT side
of both equal signs.
\item The option \var{crbefore} signals not to allow other code (so just spaces)
before the ELSE keyword on the same line.
\item The option \var{dindonkey} de-indents if the parser finds any of the keywords
 in the square brackets line (if,then,else)
\item The option \var{inbytab} means indent by a tab.
\item The option \var{upper} uppercase the keyword (else or Else becomes ELSE)
\end{itemize}

Try to play with the configfile step by step until you find the effect you desire.
The configurability and possibilities of ptop are quite large. E.g. I like all
keywords uppercased instead of capitalized, so I replaced all capital keywords in
the default file by upper.

\file{ptop} is still development software, so it is wise to visually check the generated
source and try to compile it, to see if \file{ptop} hasn't made any errors.

\subsection{ptopu unit}

The source of the \file{PtoP} program is conveniently split in two files:
One is a unit containing an object that does the actual beautifying of the
source, the other is a shell built around this object so it can be used
from the command line. This design makes it possible to include the object
in some program (e.g. an IDE) and use its features to format code.

The object resided in the \file{PtoPU} unit, and is declared as follows
\begin{verbatim}
  TPrettyPrinter=Object(TObject)
      Indent : Integer;    { How many characters to indent ? }
      InS    : PStream;
      OutS   : PStream;
      DiagS  : PStream;
      CfgS : PStream;
      Constructor Create;
      Function PrettyPrint : Boolean;
    end;
\end{verbatim}

Using this object is very simple. The procedure is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create the object, using its constructor.
\item Set the \var{Ins} stream. This is an open stream, from which pascal source will be
read. This is a mandatory step.
\item Set the \var{OutS} stream. This is an open stream, to which the
beautified pascal source will be written. This is a mandatory step.
\item Set the \var{DiagS} stream. Any diagnostics will be written to this
stream. This step is optional. If you don't set this, no diagnostics are
written.
\item Set the \var{Cfgs} stream. A configuration is read from this stream.
(see the previous section for more information about configuration). This
step is optional. If you don't set this, a default configuration is used.
\item Set the \var{Indent} variable. This is the number of spaces to use
when indenting. Tab characters are not used in the program. This step is
optional. The indent variable is initialized to 2.
\item Call \var{PrettyPrint}. This will pretty-print the source in \var{Ins}
and write the result to \var{OutS}. The function returns \var{True} if no
errors occurred, \var{False} otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

So, a minimal procedure would be:
\begin{verbatim}
Procedure CleanUpCode;

var
  Ins,OutS : PBufStream;
  PPRinter : TPrettyPrinter;

begin
  Ins:=New(PBufStream,Init('ugly.pp',StopenRead,TheBufSize));
  OutS:=New(PBufStream,Init('beauty.pp',StCreate,TheBufSize));
  PPrinter.Create;
  PPrinter.Ins:=Ins;
  PPrinter.outS:=OutS;
  PPrinter.PrettyPrint;
end;
\end{verbatim}

Using memory streams allows very fast formatting of code, and is perfectly
suitable for editors.

\section{rstconv program}

The \file{rstconv} program converts the resource string files generates by
the compiler (when you use resource string sections) to \file{.po} files
that can be understood by the GNU \file{msgfmt} program.

Its usage is very easy; it accepts the following options:
\begin{description}
\item[-i file] Use the specified file instead of stdin as input file. This
option is optional.
\item[-o file] write output to the specified file. This option is required.
\item[-f format] Specifies the output format. At the moment, only one output
format is supported: {\em po} for GNU gettext \file{.po} format.
It is the default format.
\end{description}
As an example:
\begin{verbatim}
rstconv -i resdemo.rst -o resdemo.po
\end{verbatim}
will convert the \file{resdemo.rst} file to \file{resdemo.po}.

More information on the \file{rstconv} utility can be found in the \progref,
under the chapter about resource strings.

\section{unitdiff program}

\subsection{Synopsis}
\file{unitdiff} shows differences between 2 unit interface sections. 
\begin{verbatim}
unitdiff [--disable-arguments] [--disable-private] [--disable-protected] 
[--help] [--lang=language] [--list] [--output=filename] [--sparse] 
file1 file2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Description and usage}

\file{Unitdiff} scans one or two Free Pascal unit source files and either lists all
available identifiers, or describes the differences in identifiers
between the two units.

You can invoke \file{unitdiff} with as the only required argument a
\file{input} filename. It will then simply list all available identifiers.

The regular use is to invoke \file{unitdiff} with 2 arguments:
\begin{verbatim}
unitdiff input1 input2
\end{verbatim}
It will then show the difference in interface between the two
units, or list the available identifiers in both units. The output of 
\file{unitdiff} will go to standard output by default.

\subsection{Options}
\file{unitdiff} has some options, most of them optional, defaults will be used in most
cases.

\begin{description}
\item[--disable-arguments] If this option is specified,  \file{unitdiff}
will not check the arguments of functions and procedures. By default, 
these are checked as well.
\item[--disable-private] By default, private methods of classes are checked. 
if this option is specified, private fields or methods are not checked.
\item[--disable-protected] By default, protected  methods of classes are 
checked. if this option is specified, protected and private fields or 
methods are not checked.
\item[--help] Emit a short help text and exit.
\item[--lang=language] Sets the language for the output file. This will mainly 
set the strings used for the headers in various parts of the documentation files 
(by default they're in english). Currently, valid options are
\item[--list] If this option is specified, only the list of available identifiers will be
specified for the unit or units. If only 1 unit is specified, this option is
automatically assumed.
\item[--output=filename] This option tells \file{unitdiff} where the output should go. 
If this option is not specified, the output is sent to standard output (the screen).
\item[--sparse] Turns on sparse mode. In this mode, the output will not contain the types of
the identifiers. Only the names of the identifiers are written to the
output. By default, also type descriptions are written.

\chapter{Units that come with Free Pascal}
\label{ch:Units}

Here we list the units that come with the \fpc distribution. Since there is
a difference in the supplied units per operating system, we first describe
the generic ones, then describe those which are operating specific. 

%
% Common units
%
\section{Standard units}

The following units are standard and are meant to be ported to
all supported platforms by \fpc. A brief description of each unit
is also given.

\begin{description}
\item[charset] a unit to provide mapping of character sets.
\item[cmem] Using this unit replaces the Free Pascal memory manager with the 
memory manager of the C library.
\item[crt] This unit is similar to the unit of the same name of
Turbo Pascal. It implements writing to the console in color,  moving the 
text cursor around and reading from the keyboard.
\item[dos] This unit provides basic routines for accessing the operating
system. This includes file searching, environment variables access,
getting the operating system version, getting and setting the
system time. It is to note that some of these routines are duplicated
in functionality in the \var{sysutils} unit.
\item[dynlibs] provides cross-platform access to loading dynamical libraries.
\item[errors] returns 
\item[getopts] This unit gives you the \gnu \var{getopts} command-line
arguments  handling mechanism. It also supports long options.
\item[graph] \emph{This unit is deprecated}. This unit provides basic graphics handling, with routines to
draw lines on the screen, display texts etc. It provides the same functions
as the Turbo Pascal unit. 
\item[heaptrc] a unit which debugs the heap usage. When the program exits, it outputs a summary of the used memory, and dumps a summary of unreleased memory blocks (if any).
\item[keyboard] provides basic keyboard handling routines in a platform independent way,
and supports writing custom drivers.
\item[macpas] this unit implements several functions available only in macpas mode. This units hould not be included, it's automatically included when the MACPAS mode is used.
\item[math] This unit contains common mathematical routines (trigonometric
functions, logarithms, etc.) as well as more complex ones (summations of arrays,
normalization functions, etc.).
\item[matrix] a unit providing matrix manipulation routines.
\item[mmx] This unit provides support for \var{mmx} extensions in your
code. 
\item[mouse] provides basic mouse handling routines in a platform independent way,
and supports writing custom drivers. 
\item [objects]  This unit provides the base object for standard Turbo Pascal
objects. It also implements File and Memory stream objects, as well as sorted
and non-sorted collections, and string streams.
\item[objpas] is used for Delphi compatibility; you should never load this
unit explicitly; it is automatically loaded if you request Delphi mode.
\item[printer]  This unit provides all you need for rudimentary access
to the printer using standard I/O routines.
\item[sockets] This gives the programmer access to sockets and TCP/IP 
programming.
\item[strings] This unit provides basic string handling routines for the
\var{pchar} type, comparable to similar routines in standard \var{C}
libraries.
\item[system] This unit is available for all supported platforms. It includes
among others, basic file I/O routines, memory management routines, all compiler 
helper routines, and directory services routines. 
\item[strutils] offers a lot of extended string handling routines. 
\item[dateutils] offers a lot of extended date/time handling routines for 
almost any date and time math. 
\item[sysutils] is an alternative implementation of the sysutils unit of
Delphi. It includes file I/O access routines which takes care of file
locking, date and string handling routines, file search, date and string 
conversion routines.
\item[typinfo] Provides functions to acces Run-Time Type Information, just
like Delphi.
\item[variants] provides basic variant handling.
\item[video] provides basic screen handling in a platform independent way,
and supports writing custom drivers.
\end{description}

%
% Under DOS
%
\section{Under DOS}
\begin{description}
\item [emu387] This unit provides support for the coprocessor emulator.
\item [go32] This unit provides access to possibilities of the \var{GO32}
\dos extender.
\end{description}

%
% Under Windows
%
\section{Under Windows}
\begin{description}
\item[wincrt] This implements a console in a standard GUI window, contrary
to the \var{crt} unit which is for the Windows console only.
\item[Windows] This unit provides access to al Win32 API calls. Effort has
been taken to make sure that it is compatible to the Delphi version of this
unit, so code for Delphi is easily ported to \fpc.
\item[opengl] provides access to the low-level opengl functions in \windows.
\item[winmouse] provides access to the mouse in \windows.
\item[ole2] provides access to the OLE capabilities of \windows.
\item[winsock] provides acces to the \windows sockets API Winsock.
\end{description}

%
% Under Linux
%
\section{Under Linux and BSD-like platforms}
\begin{description}
\item[baseunix] basic unix operations, basically a subset of the POSIX specification. 
Using this unit should ensure portability across most unix systems.
\item[errors] returns a string describing an operating system error code.
\item[oldlinux]  \emph{This unit is deprecated}. This unit provides access to the
\linux operating system. It provides most file and I/O handling routines
that you may need. It implements most of the standard \var{C} library constructs
that you will find on a Unix system. If you do a lot of disk/file
operations, the use of this unit is recommended over the one you use under
Dos.
\item[ports] This implements the various \var{port[]} constructs. These are
provided for compatibility only, and it is not recommended to use them
extensively. Programs using this construct must be run as ruit or setuid
root, and are a serious security risk on your system.
\item[unix] extende unix operations.
\item[unixtype] all types used commonly on unix platforms.
\end{description}

\section{Under OS/2}
\begin{description}
\item[doscalls] interface to \file{doscalls.dll}.
\item[dive] interface to \file{dive.dll}
\item[emx] provides access to the EMX extender.
\item[pm*] interface units for the program manager functions.
\item[viocalls] interface to \file{viocalls.dll} screen handling library.
\item[moucalls] interface to \file{moucalls.dll} mouse handling library.
\item[kbdcalls] interface to \file{kbdcalls.dll} keyboard handling library.
\item[moncalls] interface to \file{moncalls.dll} monitoring handling library.

\fpc supports debug information for the \gnu debugger \var{gdb}, or
its derivatives \file{Insight} on win32 or \file{ddd} on \linux.

This chapter describes shortly how to use this feature. It doesn't attempt
to describe completely the \gnu debugger, however.
For more information on the workings of the \gnu debugger, see the \var{gdb}
users' guide.

\fpc also suports \var{gprof}, the \gnu profiler, see section \ref{se:gprof}
for more information on profiling.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compiling your program with debugger support
\section{Compiling your program with debugger support}
First of all, you must be sure that the compiler is compiled with debugging
support. Unfortunately, there is no way to check this at run time, except by
trying to compile a program with debugging support.

To compile a program with debugging support, just specify the \var{-g}
option on the command-line, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
fpc -g hello.pp
\end{verbatim}
This will generate debugging information in the executable from your
program. You will notice that the size of the executable increases
substantially because of this\footnote{A good reason not to include debug
information in an executable you plan to distribute.}.

Note that the above will only generate debug information {\em for the code
that has been generated} when compiling \file{hello.pp}. This means that if
you used some units (the system unit, for instance) which were not compiled
with debugging support, no debugging support will be available for the code
in these units.

There are 2 solutions for this problem.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Recompile all units manually with the \var{-g} option.
\item Specify the 'build' option (\var{-B}) when compiling with debugging
support. This will recompile all units, and insert debugging information in
each of the units.
\end{enumerate}
The second option may have undesirable side effects. It may be that some
units aren't found, or compile incorrectly due to missing conditionals,
etc..

If all went well, the executable now contains the necessary information with
which you can debug it using \gnu \var{gdb}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Using gdb
\section{Using \var{gdb} to debug your program}
\label{se:usinggdb}

To use gdb to debug your program, you can start the debugger, and give it as
an option the {\em full} name of your program:
\begin{verbatim}
gdb hello
\end{verbatim}
Or, under \dos :
\begin{verbatim}
gdb hello.exe
\end{verbatim}

This starts the debugger, and the debugger immediately loads your program
into memory, but it does not run the program yet. Instead, you are presented
with the following (more or less) message, followed by the \var{gdb} prompt
\var{'(gdb)'}:
\begin{verbatim}
GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies of it
 under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type "show warranty" for details.
GDB 4.15.1 (i486-slackware-linux),
Copyright 1995 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
(gdb)
\end{verbatim}
To start the program you can use the \var{run} command. You can optionally
specify command-line parameters, which will then be fed to your program, for
example:
\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) run -option -anotheroption needed_argument
\end{verbatim}
If your program runs without problems, \var{gdb} will inform you of this,
and return the exit code of your program. If the exit code was zero, then
the message \var{'Program exited normally'} is displayed.

If something went wrong (a segmentation fault or so), \var{gdb} will stop
the execution of your program, and inform you of this with an appropriate
message. You can then use the other \var{gdb} commands to see what happened.
Alternatively, you can instruct \var{gdb} to stop at a certain point in your
program, with the \var{break} command.

Here is a short list of \var{gdb} commands, which you are likely to need when
debugging your program:
\begin{description}
\item [quit\ ] Exits the debugger.
\item [kill\ ] Stops a running program.
\item [help\ ] Gives help on all \var{gdb} commands.
\item [file\ ] Loads a new program into the debugger.
\item [directory\ ] Add a new directory to the search path for source
files.\\
\begin{remark} My copy of gdb needs '.' to be added explicitly to the search
path, otherwise it doesn't find the sources.
\end{remark}
\item [list\ ] Lists the program sources per 10 lines. As an option you can
specify a line number or function name.
\item [break\ ] Sets a breakpoint at a specified line or function
\item [awatch\ ] Sets a watch-point for an expression. A watch-point stops
execution of your program whenever the value of an expression is either
read or written.
\end{description}

for more information, see the \var{gdb} users' guide, or use the \var{'help'}
function in \var{gdb}.

The appendix {\ref{ch:GdbIniFile}} contains a sample init file for
\var{gdb}, which produces good results when debugging \fpc programs.

It is also possible to use \file{RHIDE}, a text-based IDE that uses gdb.
There is a version of RHIDE available that can work together with FPC.

\section{Caveats when debugging with \var{gdb}}

There are some peculiarities of \fpc which you should be aware of when using
\var{gdb}. We list the main ones here:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \fpc generates information for GDB in uppercare letters. This is a
consequence of the fact that pascal is a case insensitive language. So, when
referring to a variable or function, you need to make its name all
uppercase.

As an example, of you want to watch the value of a loop variable
\var{count}, you should type
\begin{verbatim}
watch COUNT
\end{verbatim}
Or if you want stop when a certain function (e.g \var{MyFunction}) is called,
type
\begin{verbatim}
break MYFUNCTION
\end{verbatim}

\item \var{gdb} does not know sets.

\item \var{gdb} doesn't know strings. Strings are represented in \var{gdb}
as records with a length field and an array of char contaning the string.

You can also use the following user function to print strings:
\begin{verbatim}
define pst
set $pos=&$arg0
set $strlen = {byte}$pos
print {char}&$arg0.st@($strlen+1)
end

document pst
  Print out a Pascal string
end
\end{verbatim}
If you insert it in your \file{gdb.ini} file, you can look at a string with this
function. There is a sample \file{gdb.ini} in appendix \ref{ch:GdbIniFile}.

\item Objects are difficult to handle, mainly because \var{gdb} is oriented
towards C and C++. The workaround implemented in \fpc is that object methods
are represented as functions, with an extra parameter \var{this} (all
lowercase !) The name of this function is a concatenation of the object type
and the function name, separated by two underscore characters.

For example, the method \var{TPoint.Draw} would be converted to
\var{TPOINT\_\_DRAW}, and could be stopped at with
\begin{verbatim}
break TPOINT__DRAW
\end{verbatim}

\item Global overloaded functions confuse \var{gdb} because they have the same
name. Thus you cannot set a breakpoint at an overloaded function, unless you
know its line number, in which case you can set a breakpoint at the
starting linenumber of the function.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Using gprof
\section{Support for \var{gprof}, the \gnu profiler}
\label{se:gprof}

You can compile your programs with profiling support. for this, you just
have to use the compiler switch \var{-pg}. The compiler wil insert the
necessary stuff for profiling.

When you have done this, you can run your program as you normally would run
it.
\begin{verbatim}
yourexe
\end{verbatim}
Where \file{yourexe} is the name of your executable.

When your program finishes a file called gmon.out is generated. Then you can start
the profiler to see the output. You can better redirect the output to a file, becuase
it could be quite a lot:
\begin{verbatim}
gprof yourexe > profile.log
\end{verbatim}

Hint: you can use the --flat option to reduce the amount of output of gprof. It will
then only output the information about the timings

For more information on the \gnu profiler \var{gprof}, see its manual.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Checking the heap
\section{Detecting heap memory leaks}
\label{se:heaptrc}
\fpc has a built in mechanism to detect memory leaks. There is a plug-in
unit for the memory manager that analyses the memory allocation/deallocation
and which prints a memory usage report after the program exits.

The unit that does this is called \file{heaptrc}. If you want to use it,
you should include it as the first unit in you uses clause. Alternatively,
you can supply the \var{-gh} switch to the compiler, and it will include
the unit automatically for you.

After the program exits, you will get a report looking like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Marked memory at 0040FA50 invalid
Wrong size : 128 allocated 64 freed
  0x00408708
  0x0040CB49
  0x0040C481
Call trace for block 0x0040FA50 size 128
  0x0040CB3D
  0x0040C481
\end{verbatim}
The output of the heaptrc unit is customizable by setting some variables.
Output can also be customized using environment variables.

You can find more information about the usage of the \file{heaptrc} unit
in the \unitsref.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Verbose Run-time errors.
\section{Line numbers in run-time error backtraces}
\label{se:lineinfo}

Normally, when a run-time error occurs, you are presented with a list
of addresses that represent the call stack backtrace, i.e. the addresses
of all procedures that were invoked when the run-time error occurred.

This list is not very informative, so there exists a unit that generates
the file names and line numbers of the called procedures using the
addresses of the stack backtrace. This unit is called lineinfo.

You can use this unit by giving the \var{-gl} option to the compiler. The
unit will be automatically included. It is also possible to use the unit
explicitly in your \var{uses} clause, but you must make sure that you
compile your program with debug info.

Here is an example program:
\begin{verbatim}
program testline;

procedure generateerror255;

begin
  runerror(255);
end;

procedure generateanerror;

begin
  generateerror255;
end;

begin
  generateanerror;
end.
\end{verbatim}
When compiled with \var{-gl}, the following output is generated:
\begin{verbatim}
Runtime error 255 at 0x0040BDE5
  0x0040BDE5  GENERATEERROR255,  line 6 of testline.pp
  0x0040BDF0  GENERATEANERROR,  line 13 of testline.pp
  0x0040BE0C  main,  line 17 of testline.pp
  0x0040B7B1
\end{verbatim}
Which is more understandable than the normal message. Make sure that all
units you use are compiled with debug info, because if they are not, no
line number and filename can be found.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Combining heaptrc and lineinfo
\section{Combining \file{heaptrc} and \file{lineinfo}}

If you combine the lineinfo and the heaptrc information, then the output
of the \file{heaptrc} unit will contain the names of the files and line
numbers of the procedures that occur in the stack backtrace.

In such a case, the output will look something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Marked memory at 00410DA0 invalid
Wrong size : 128 allocated 64 freed
  0x004094B8
  0x0040D8F9  main,  line 25 of heapex.pp
  0x0040D231
Call trace for block 0x00410DA0 size 128
  0x0040D8ED  main,  line 23 of heapex.pp
  0x0040D231
\end{verbatim}
If lines without filename/line-number occur, this means there is a unit which
has no debug info included. (in the above case, the getmem call itself)

\chapter{Run time errors}

Applications generated  by \fpc might generate
Run time error when certain abnormal conditions are
detected in the application. This appendix lists the possible run time
errors and gives information on why they might be produced.

\begin{description}
\item [1  Invalid function number]
An invalid operating system call was attempted.

\item [2  File not found]
Reported when trying to erase, rename or open a non-existent
file.

\item [3  Path not found]
Reported by the directory handling routines when a path does not 
exist or is invalid. Also reported when trying to access a 
non-existent file.

\item [4  Too many open files]
The maximum number of currently opened files by your process
has been reached. Certain operating systems limit the number
of files which can be opened concurrently, and this error
can occur when this limit has been reached.

\item [5  File access denied]
Permission accessing the file is denied. This error might
be caused by several reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item   Trying to open for writing a file which is
               read only, or which is actually a directory.
       \item   File is currently locked or used by another process.
       \item   Trying to create a new file, or directory while a 
               file or directory of the same name already exists.
       \item   Trying to read from a file which was opened
               in write only mode.
       \item   Trying to write from a file which was opened
               in read only mode.
       \item   Trying to remove a directory or file while
               it is not possible.
       \item   No permission to access the file or directory.        
    \end{itemize}

\item [6  Invalid file handle]
If this happens, the file variable you are using is trashed; it
indicates that your memory is corrupted.

\item [12  Invalid file access code]
Reported when a reset or rewrite is called with an invalid \var{FileMode}
value.

\item [15  Invalid drive number]
The number given to the \var{Getdir} or \var{ChDir} function specifies a 
non-existent disk.

\item [16  Cannot remove current directory]
Reported when trying to remove the currently active directory.

\item [17  Cannot rename across drives]
You cannot rename a file such that it would end up on another disk or
partition.

\item [100  Disk read error]
An error occurred when reading from disk. Typically when you try
to read past the end of a file.

\item [101  Disk write error]
Reported when the disk is full, and you're trying to write to it.

\item [102  File not assigned]
This is reported by \var{Reset}, \var{Rewrite}, \var{Append}, 
\var{Rename} and \var{Erase}, if you call
them with an unassigned file as a parameter.

\item [103  File not open]
Reported by the following functions : \var{Close, Read, Write, Seek,
EOf, FilePos, FileSize, Flush, BlockRead,} and \var{BlockWrite} if the 
file is not open.

\item [104  File not open for input]
Reported by \var{Read, BlockRead, Eof, Eoln, SeekEof} or \var{SeekEoln} if 
the file is not opened with \var{Reset}.

\item [105  File not open for output]
Reported by write if a text file isn't opened with \var{Rewrite}.

\item [106  Invalid numeric format]
Reported when a non-numeric value is read from a text file, when a numeric
value was expected.

\item [150  Disk is write-protected]
(Critical error)
\item [151  Bad drive request struct length]
(Critical error)
\item [152  Drive not ready]
(Critical error)
\item [154  CRC error in data]
(Critical error)
\item [156  Disk seek error]
(Critical error)
\item [157  Unknown media type]
(Critical error)
\item [158  Sector Not Found]
(Critical error)
\item [159  Printer out of paper]
(Critical error)
\item [160  Device write fault]
(Critical error)
\item [161  Device read fault]
(Critical error)
\item [162  Hardware failure]
(Critical error)
\item [200  Division by zero]
The application attempted to divide a number by zero.
\item [201  Range check error]
If you compiled your program with range checking on, then you can get this
error in the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An array was accessed with an index outside its declared range.
\item Trying to assign a value to a variable outside its range (for
instance an enumerated type).
\end{enumerate}
\item [202  Stack overflow error]
The stack has grown beyond its maximum size (in which case the size of 
local variables should be reduced to avoid this error), or the stack has 
become corrupt. This error is only reported when stack checking is enabled.
\item [203  Heap overflow error]
The heap has grown beyond its boundaries. This is caused when trying to allocate
memory exlicitly with \var{New}, \var{GetMem} or \var{ReallocMem}, or when
a class or object instance is created and no memory is left. Please note 
that, by default, \fpc provides a growing heap, i.e. the heap will
try to allocate more memory if needed. However, if the heap has reached the
maximum size allowed by the operating system or hardware, then you will get
this error.
\item [204  Invalid pointer operation]
This you will get if you call \var{Dispose} or \var{Freemem} with an invalid 
pointer (notably, \var{Nil})
\item [205  Floating point overflow]
You are trying to use or produce too large real numbers.
\item [206  Floating point underflow]
You are trying to use or produce too small real numbers.
\item [207  Invalid floating point operation]
Can occur if you try to calculate the square root or logarithm of a negative
number.
\item [210  Object not initialized]
When compiled with range checking on, a program will report this error if
you call a virtual method without having called istr constructor.
\item [211  Call to abstract method]
Your program tried to execute an abstract virtual method. Abstract methods
should be overridden, and the overriding method should be called.
\item [212  Stream registration error]
This occurs when an invalid type is registered in the objects unit.
\item [213  Collection index out of range]
You are trying to access a collection item with an invalid index
(\var{objects} unit).
\item [214  Collection overflow error]
The collection has reached its maximal size, and you are trying to add
another element (\var{objects} unit).
\item[215 Arithmetic overflow error]
This error is reported when the result of an arithmetic operation
is outside of its supported range. Contrary to Turbo Pascal, this error
is only reported for 32-bit or 64-bit arithmetic overflows. This is due
to the fact that everything is converted to 32-bit or 64-bit before
doing the actual arithmetic operation.
\item [216  General Protection fault]
The application tried to access invalid memory space. This can
be caused by several problems:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Deferencing a \var{nil} pointer
 \item Trying to access memory which is out of bounds
       (for example, calling \var{move} with an invalid length).
\end{enumerate}

\item [217 Unhandled exception occurred]
An exception occurred, and there was no exception handler present.
The \var{sysutils} unit installs a default exception handler which catches
all excpetions and exits gracefully.

\item [219 Invalid typecast]

Thrown when an invalid typecast is attempted on a class using the \var{as}
operator. This error is also thrown when an object or class is
typecast to an invalid class or object and a virtual method of
that class or object is called. This last error is only detected
if the \var{-CR} compiler option is used.

\item [227 Assertion failed error]
An assertion failed, and no \var{AssertErrorProc} procedural variable was 
installed.

Here you have a sample \file{gdb.ini} file listing, which gives better
results when using \var{gdb}. Under \linux you should put this in a
\file{.gdbinit} file in your home directory or the current directory..

\begin{verbatim}
set print demangle off
set gnutarget auto
set verbose on
set complaints 1000

set print pretty on
disp /i $eip

define pst
set $pos=&$arg0
set $strlen = {byte}$pos
print {char}&$arg0.st@($strlen+1)
end

document pst
  Print out a pascal string
